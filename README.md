A rather basic **set class in C++17**, originally written for a school assignment.
There are **two separate implementations**. One uses a **static array**, while the 
other relies on a **vector container** for optimized memory usage and ease-of-use. 
However, they are completely interchangeable, as they share member function signatures.

## FEATURES
### Implemented
*   \[x] Set creation / deletion.
*   \[x] Add elements.
*   \[x] Delete elements.
*   \[x] Empty a set.
*   \[x] Get the size.
*   \[x] Check for an element.
*   \[x] Check for a subset.
*   \[x] Check for a proper subset.
*   \[x] Complement of a set, given a universal set.
*   \[x] Union of two sets.
*   \[x] Arithmetic mean of a set.
*   \[x] Sort elements of a set.
*   \[x] Print out a set.

### To Do
*   \[ ] Difference of two sets.
*   \[ ] Reverse difference of two sets.
*   \[ ] Symmetric difference of two sets.
*   \[ ] Intersection of two sets.
*   \[ ] Cartesian product of two sets.
*   \[ ] Mutable universal set.

## USAGE
Add `SetArray.h` and `SetArray.cpp`, or `SetVector.h` and `SetVector.cpp` 
to your codebase of choice. Make sure to include the right header file for your needs: 

```cpp
#include "SetArray.h"
``` 
```cpp
#include "SetVector.h"
``` 

## COMPILATION
I have written two source files to try out the class: `mainTests.cpp` and 
`mainTestsEspecific.cpp`. If you feel inclined to compile them, make sure to 
comment / uncomment the following line at the top, to switch between implementations.

``` cpp
#define VECTOR
```
Feel free to use the provided `makefile` or `code/build.bat` (if you're on Windows). If you wish to compile it on your own, make sure to configure the compiler toolchain for C++17.
